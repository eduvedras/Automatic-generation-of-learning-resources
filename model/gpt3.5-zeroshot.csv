Titanic_decision_tree.png,"'It is possible to state that Naive Bayes algorithm classifies (A,B), as 0.'"
Titanic_overfitting_mlp.png,"""Overfitting typically occurs when the training accuracy of a model continues to increase while the validation accuracy starts decreasing."""
Titanic_overfitting_gb.png,"In the given chart, the accuracy decreases as the number of estimators increases."
Titanic_overfitting_rf.png,The overfitting of random forest models increases as the number of estimators increases.
Titanic_overfitting_knn.png,KNN with 1 neighbor is in overfitting.
Titanic_overfitting_decision_tree.png,"According to the decision tree overfitting chart, the accuracy decreases as the max depth increases, indicating overfitting."
Titanic_overfitting_dt_acc_rec.png,The accuracy of the decision tree decreases as the max depth increases due to overfitting.
Titanic_pca.png,The first principal component explains the highest variance among the 5 principal components.
Titanic_correlation_heatmap.png,The variables Parch and Fare show a strong positive correlation in the dataset.
Titanic_boxplots.png,Outliers seem to be a problem in the dataset.
Titanic_histograms_symbolic.png,The set of bar charts will display the distribution of the variables 'Embarked' and 'Sex'.
Titanic_mv.png,It is better to drop the variable Embarked than removing all records with missing values.
Titanic_class_histogram.png,The bar chart provides information about the distribution of the target variable Survived.
Titanic_nr_records_nr_variables.png,The bar chart displays the count of records and variables in the dataset.
Titanic_histograms_numeric.png,The variable Age can be seen as ordinal.
