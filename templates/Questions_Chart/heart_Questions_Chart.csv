Dropping all records with missing values would be better than to drop the variables with missing values.;['heart_mv']
Dropping all rows with missing values can lead to a dataset with less than 40% of the original data.;['heart_mv']
Dropping all rows with missing values can lead to a dataset with less than 30% of the original data.;['heart_mv']
Dropping all rows with missing values can lead to a dataset with less than 25% of the original data.;['heart_mv']
There is no reason to believe that discarding records showing missing values is safer than discarding the corresponding variables in this case.;['heart_mv']
Dummification is mandatory in this dataset.;[]
Dummifying the variables will improve the mining results.;[]
